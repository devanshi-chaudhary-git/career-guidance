Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic and interactivity.

Firebase:

Firestore: NoSQL cloud database for real-time data storage and synchronization.

Authentication: Manages user authentication (anonymous and custom token).

Canvas Confetti: A lightweight JavaScript library for generating celebration animations.

Getting Started
To run this application locally or integrate it into your Firebase project, follow these steps:

Firebase Setup
Create a Firebase Project: If you haven't already, create a new project in the Firebase Console.

Enable Firestore: In your Firebase project, navigate to "Firestore Database" and create a new database. Choose "Start in production mode" and configure your security rules (see step 3).

Configure Firestore Security Rules: To allow users to read and write their private data, set up the following rules in your Firestore Database -> Rules tab:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

These rules ensure that a user can only read and write data within their own /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/ path if they are authenticated and their uid matches the userId in the path.

Enable Anonymous Authentication: In your Firebase project, navigate to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" and enable "Anonymous" provider. This allows the application to sign in users without requiring explicit credentials, providing a seamless initial experience.

Running the Application
This application is designed to run within the Google Gemini Canvas environment, which automatically provides the necessary __app_id, __firebase_config, and __initial_auth_token global variables.

If you wish to run it outside this environment for development or testing:

Copy the HTML Content: Copy the entire HTML code from the career-guidance-app Canvas document.

Save as an HTML file: Save the content into an index.html file.

Replace Global Variables (for local testing):

Locate the const appId, const firebaseConfig, and const initialAuthToken declarations within the <script type="module"> tag.

Replace the placeholder values ('default-app-id', { /* your original firebase config */ }, null) with your actual Firebase project's configuration and a valid custom auth token if you are using one for testing. For basic anonymous sign-in, you can keep initialAuthToken as null and ensure anonymous authentication is enabled in Firebase.

Example of hardcoding firebaseConfig for local testing (use your actual values):

const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

Open in Browser: Open the index.html file in your web browser.

How to Use
Add New Career Interest: Click the "Add New Career Interest" button.

Enter Details: A floating modal will appear. Enter your name and your career interest.

Save: Click "Save Interest". A celebration animation will play, and your interest will appear in the "Saved Career Interests" list in real-time.

View Interests: The list of saved career interests updates automatically as new entries are added by you or other users (if you were to implement a public collection based on different security rules).
